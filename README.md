# timer
Simple script for calculating the average run time of a command over n iterations.

## Usage
`timer [iterations] command`

`iterations` defaults to 10 if you omit it

If, for some reason, the command you're running is composed entirely of numbers, you'll have to provide some number of iterations.

Output is in seconds.
